# Coffeegonewild

## Description
This project was implemented as a part of the Python full-stack sofeware development course at Coding Dojo. The main purpose was to practice and to showcase the technologies and skillsets that I have acquired during the bootcamp. 

As a coffee enthusiast myself, I often seek for exotic coffee recipes but found it frustrating due to the scatterness of the resources. Therefore, I wanted to create an online library of the most unique coffee recipes so that people like me can enjoy exotic coffee drinks even without stepping out of the house. 

Besides the technologies, the two most important skills that I have improved on were project management and problem solving, both of the which were critical in ensuring smooth development and on-time delivery of the project.
